SESAMME - Simultaneous Estimates of Star-cluster Age, Metallicity, Mass, and Extinction
=======================================================================================

A Python package for full spectral fitting of the integrated-light spectrum of star clusters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

Usage
-----

Documentation for SESAMME (including this README) is under active development, so please check back regularly for new updates. The full documentation for the code, including installation instructions, can be found on its Read the Docs page (https://sesamme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

We provide example Jupyter Notebooks showing the workflow of using SESAMME for modeling a star cluster spectrum, from the creation of a compatible .FITS cube containing your desired stellar population models to post-MCMC run analyses and data visualizations. Please see the `docs/notebooks` and `docs/example_data` directories on this repository to preview and download these notebooks and the accompanying data.
